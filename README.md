##### I am a sixteen year old student looking foward to go into Hunter College in the upcoming Fall 2019. I was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York with two older twin siblings. They are both in college and they inspire me to do bigger and better things with my future and career. 


I am a horrible test taker due to my test anxiety. I love things that people think are weird like taking walks alone, spending time with myself and exploring new ways to interact with different groups of people.
My anxiety gets to me a lot, but I am a man-made girl striving on my own. 


People judge me a lot, and I hate it. I know how to control myself within my surroundings,
but some don't and it's totally fine. That's why I cope with theirs 
and try to help them if they need it. I may not be great in every aspect in life, including school, but I try to find ways to cope with it knowing my limitations.

#### **I have traveled to many places including:**
<ul>
    <li>Egypt</li>
     Including both Cairo and Alexandria of course!
    <li>Orlando, Florida</li>
    <li>Poughkeepsie, New York</li>
    <li>Syracuse, New York</li>
</ul>

I love exploring although I may not be great at everything.


**Yup well that is me, Donia Abdelhalim!   
Hope you enjoyed my all about me.**
